## Efficiency

Create complex road systems in minutes. Customizable road cuts allows for efficient collision detection and material customization.

## Terrain

Multi-terrain road construction supported. Matches the terrain allowing for disabled mesh collisions.

## Dynamic

Procedurally generated based upon lanes, road width and angle of attack.

## Turn lanes

Complete left and right optional turn lanes.

## Traffic lights

Fully functioning and heavily detailed traffic light system including left on yield and right turn lane only lights.

## Assets

Includes several assets such as traffic light poles, street lights, traffic lights, stop signs and more. Most include rigid body versions for dynamic environments.

## Bridges

### Bridge wizard

Allows for instant creation of professional quality bridges such as causeway, arch, suspension and more. All bridge creation aspects are generated instantly allowing quick iteration.

### Custom

Custom extrusion allows for mix and match of bridge parts. Over 50 bridge parts included.

### Details

Many different types of railing, bases, center dividers included.

### Curvature

Curvature of bridges supported.

## Railing, barriers and more

### Railing

12+ Railing types included such as K-Rails and W Beams.

### Center dividers

Many center divider options including the most popular configurations such as K-Rails with blinders or street lights. All aspects of mesh extrusion are performed instantly allowing quick iteration.

### Collision barriers

Water barrels and other collision barriers come with prefabricated rigid or static body configurations.

### Custom extrusion

Extrude any custom mesh along the spline with almost limitless customization.

## Street lights, signs and more

### Road assets

several road assets included such as street lights, double lights, stop signs and more. All aspects of road asset placement are done instantly, allowing for quick iterations.

### Custom assets

Place any custom mesh along the spline with an extreme amount of customization options.

### Signs

300+ U.S. federal and state road signs are pre-built and available for use.

### Future assets

Assets will be added and freely available as time progresses.

## Quality

### Speed

All mesh extrusion, bridge extrusion and road asset placement actions are instantaneous. Optimized road generation results in an average 100ms per (2km road + 1 intersection). Multithreaded support.

### Quality

Most road textures at least 1024x1024 resolution. Most materials include normal and specular maps. Most assets created to federal or state specification.

### Customization

Full customization is available. Hundreds of customization options. Full source code.

# Other information:

*   ## Future support

    Guaranteed updates until at minimum 2016\. Full integration with future GSD AI Traffic system. Mesh content will be added periodically.

*   ## Lane limitations

    The number of lanes per road is currently limited to 2, 4 and 6\. An upcoming feature addresses this.

# Upcoming features:

*   ## Advanced T intersections

    3-way intersections (no turn lane, left lane turn only) are currently supported as a feature. In the future 3-way intersections with both turn lanes will be supported as a feature.

*   ## Advanced intersection lane interpretation

    In the current version of Road Architect, the two intersecting roads must have the same number of lanes. In the future different number of lanes per road per intersection will be supported as a feature.

*   ## Full compatibility with GSD Traffic

    In the future, Road Architect will be fully compatible with GSD Traffic, a fully automated and tweakable AI traffic system for roads.

*   ## One lane roads and more

    In the future, Road Architect will support a road containing 1 to 10 lanes.

*   ## More assets

    As time progresses, more and more road assets will be added such as signs, road construction items and more.

*   ## More bridges

    As time progresses, more road bridges will be added as selectable bridge types from the wizard.

*   ## More road options

    As time progresses, more road options will be added such as roundabouts and cul-de-sacs.

# Future roadmap:

*   <div>Features listed here are future features which we have not fully committed to develop at this time, but might in the future.</div>

*   ## Highway cloverleafs and on-ramps

    Support of dynamically generated highway cloverleafs, on-ramps, exits and more.

*   ## Highway rest stops and more

    Support of dynamically generated rest stops, gas stations and more.

# About Road Architect:

*   Road Architect was created with over 2600 man hours of development. It's primary purpose was to allow MicroGSD LLC to create massive AAA quality road systems across very large terrains, exceeding 256km x 256km distances. Another top goal was to allow the road system to be created fast and easily in order to be able to facilitate a realistic looking 256km x 256km area.
*   At the time of its creation and release, no other Unity asset add-on offered multi turn lane automated traffic light intersections, smart terrain history with the allowance of terrain editing after road generation, dynamic deck arch bridges, dynamic suspension bridges, road & shoulder mesh physical mats, multithreaded generation, source code availability and more.
*   We've significantly exceeded our goals for Road Architect and hope you enjoy the exceedingly great value Road Architect provides.
